## Summary
I want to joining a team that practices code-review, where code quality and desire for growth are valued. I want to apply my knowledge and learn new things in the process.
I'm continuing self education, taking courses on frontend, performing pet-projects, solving tasks on codewars and similar resources. I'm interested in what is happening in the industry: reading articles, listening to IT-podcasts and visiting frontend-meetups.

## Skills
* HTML/CSS 
* BEM (for naming)
* SASS
* Gulp
* JavaScript
* VueJS (basics)
* Git
* Figma/Photoshop/Zeplin
