## Summary
I want to joining a team that practices code-review, where code quality and desire for growth are valued. I want to apply my knowledge and learn new things in the process.
I'm continuing self education, taking courses on frontend, performing pet-projects, solving tasks on codewars and similar resources. I'm interested in what is happening in the industry: reading articles, listening to IT-podcasts and visiting frontend-meetups.

## Skills
* HTML/CSS 
* BEM (for naming)
* SASS
* Gulp
* JavaScript
* VueJS (basics)
* Git
* Figma/Photoshop/Zeplin

## Code examples
Some examples of my self-education results you can see on my [github](https://github.com/katefaith)

## Experience 
During my master's degree I worked on developing effective sorting algorithms. I had experience in C++ and other programming languages when I was a student.

I perform layout tasks (HTML/CSS) at my current job (seo specialist) sometimes.
